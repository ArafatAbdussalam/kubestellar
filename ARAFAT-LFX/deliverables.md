## Proposal Title:

Building KubeStellar Design System

## Duration:

Twelve (12) weeks

## Stakeholders:

User Experience and Interface Designers, Front-end Developers, Engineering Managers, Design Managers, Developer Experience Engineers, Open-source Maintainers.

## About KubeStellar:

KubeStellar enables the deployment of Kubernetes resources.

## The Problem:

Right now, KubeStellar does not have an established design guideline and principles that can be implemented consistently across the different active KubeStellar project areas.

## The Solution:

Build KubeStellarâ€™s design system at the foundational phase.

KubeStellar's design system enables the implementation of standardised design principles and guidelines that ensure visual consistency, usability, shared patterns, and alignment when users interact with the KubeStellar documentation sites, command-line interface tools, and other KubeStellar projects. The design system provides resources that can be integrated and implemented by designers and developers, and can be adapted across growing multiple platforms and use-cases. 


## Project Deliverables:

### Stakeholder Meeting
- Introduce the scope of the project to the involved stakeholders
- Seek clarity and perspectives on the project scope to identify key priorities, goals, deliverables, established standards, and performance indicators

### Audit Kubestellar user interfaces
- Evaluate the current KubeStellar design files, if available
- Interact with the different KubeStellar project areas
- Explore user interface elements and CSS variables in the engineering code
- Identify inconsistencies and redundancies between the current design and code

### Define the Principles
- Ensure the alignment and understanding of KubeStellar brand standard, voice and tone guides
- Communicate the driven value and focus of the design system, such as accessibility or visual consistency

### Define the Foundation
- Map out CSS specifications such as color, typography, spacing, iconography, and dimensions
- Map out components such as buttons, navbar, forms, links, and cards
- Architect design token through CSS variables and styles

### Build the Design System in Figma
- Build the foundation already defined in the step above, such as components and variables
- Iterate on the defined foundation
- Organize the Figma library
- Document the design system

## Success Metrics:
- Track the percentage increase in the rates of components, variables, and styles usage
- Monitor the interaction with the design system documentation
- Take note of data observed and gathered to identify bottlenecks such as bugs,  designer and developers new need
- Enable ticketing to understand further concerns and turn them into actionable solutions
- Integrate Figma Library Analytics tools for observing and monitoring design system Performance 


## What is next?:
- Publish blog posts, insights, and case studies on the challenges faced and processes involved when building the KubeStellar design system
- Present the business impact and report of the design system project at stakeholder meetings, tech conferences, and events
