## Front-end Development projects

- **[Qr Code Generator](https://github.com/ArafatAbdussalam/QR-Code-Generator)**: I built an accessible React web app that allows users to generate QR code based on different input values such as email, link, text, and numbers. When users click a button, they can see that the values change based on the data structures that I implemented. The web app is accessible and can be navigated with keyboards as assistive technologies. I wrote the unit test for the web app using Jest. I like this project because it was my first side project and I was keen on getting the data structures and algorithm right. **[You can interact with the web app here](https://my-qr-code-app.netlify.app/)**.

- **[Music Playlist App](https://github.com/growwithuduak/geek-devs-frontend/blob/Feat/Arafat-and-Mercy-music-app/src/components/Button/Button.stories.jsx)**: This project was my first touchpoint with Storybook for building design system.

## Product Design Projects

- **[Design System with Figma]()**: This is a Work in Progress. I am currently learning how to build design system with Figma.

## Technical Writing Projects
- **[Next.Js Unit Testing and End-to-End Testing with Vitest and Playwright](https://strapi.io/blog/nextjs-testing-guide-unit-and-e2e-tests-with-vitest-and-playwright)**: In this article, readers will learn how to write unit tests for their synchronous server components using Vitest and React Testing Library, and end-to-end tests for their async server components using Playwright. I like this article because of the method I used to explain the APIs while equally using Olympics and Cuisines as interactive learning aid for the web app.
  
- **[Web Performance Optimization in Nex.Js](https://strapi.io/blog/web-performance-optimization-in-nextjs)**: In this article, readers will learn how the Core Web Vitals (CWV) metrics are affected by the resources used in their web app; how to implement best practices for improving the performance of their Next.js application and understand how to measure the performance of their optimized web app. I like this article because of my use of Visuals to demonstrate the changes in the web application using the network throttling effect.

- **[What exactly is UX/UI design? Beyond the buzz buzz Figma Design](https://arafatsalam.hashnode.dev/what-exactly-is-uxui-beyond-the-buzz-buzz-figma-design)**: In this article, readers will learn the principles of user experience and user interface design from the design thinking perspective. I like this article because the first touchpoint in my career was Product Design, and that has formed a solid foundation in my career progression.

- **[The Software Engineering Guide to the Psychology of Learning]()**: This article deeply explains the principles of career growth in software engineering. It is intended for all categories of individuals, newbies and experts inclusive. I like this article because the title resonates with my undergraduate course in Psychology. More so, it is a reflection of my career growth and I still reference the article when I need to do some deep work.

## Open-Source Projects

- **[KubeEdge Case Study User Interface](https://github.com/kubeedge/website/pull/405)**: I built the user interface for KubeEdge case study section. I like this project. The UI can be previewed in the image attached below:
